5. Users sign in with their Google account, then add Cornell courses and sessions to their profile to build their course schedule. They can search based on course and session preferences, and the app will recommend the top 10 users who share the same courses, sessions, or optional interests.

Backend:
We designed our backend with a relational database structure to support course data, interactions between users, and personalized matching. We have some predefined tables: Course, Session, Major, InterestCategory, and Interest. For courses and sessions, we fetch all  courses and sessions from Cornell Class Roster.

At the final part, we implemented a matching and recommendation system that suggests the top 10 most compatible study buddies for user in a specific course or session. The matching logic is based on overlapping class sessions, shared majors, and common interests.

[Login Authentication]
Routes: POST(Google OAuth login)
Google login auto creates a User row in the USER TABLE

[User Profiles]
Routes: GET(user) & POST(update user) & DELETE(user)
USER table connects to SESSION TABLE, FRIEND TABLE, MESSAGE TABLE, MAJOR TABLE, INTEREST TABLE through relationships
(INTERESTCATEGORY TABLE and INTEREST TABLE is one-to-many relationship)

[Friendships]
Routes: GET(friends) & POST(friend request/accept or deny) & DELETE(fiend)
USER TABLE and FRIEND TABLE is one-to-many relationship (friends reference two users).

[Courses and Sessions]
Routes: GET(all courses/course with all sessions) & DELETE(course/session)
COURSE TABLE and SESSION TABLE is one-to-many relationship, SESSION TABLE and USER TABLE is many-to-many relationships.

[Schedule]
Routes: GET(user's schedule) & POST(add session to schedule) & DELETE(session from schedule)

[Messaging System] (only has code in backend)
Routes: POST(send message) & GET(conversation history/inbox preview) & DELETE(message)
USER TABLE and MESSAGE TABLE is one-to-many relationship

[Matching and Recommendations]
Routes: GET(relevant courses/sessions) & POST(suggests top 10 study buddies)
Matching logic evaluates shared sessions, majors, interests

Frontend:
1. Login Page Using Google
The app begins with a welcome/sign-in screen that prompts the user to sign in using Google. There's a “Continue with Google” button that triggers Google OAuth. Once tapped, the user is redirected to the Google account selection screen, where users can select an existing account already logged in on the device, or users may enter their email and password through the standard Google login pages. After successful authentication, the app returns the user to a personalized welcome screen (e.g., Welcome, John).

2. Setting Up Personal Information (Profile Creation Flow)
After logging in for the first time, the user is guided through a multi-step profile setup.
(1st screen) Basic Info that asks for First name, Last name, Pronouns. Once these fields are validated, and users can proceed using the Next button.
(2nd screen) Contact Info that asks for Email (auto-filled from Google login but still shown), Phone number
(3rd screen) A profile photo screen that allows users to upload a profile picture from their device, or skip the step.
(Final profile preview screen) shows Profile photo, Name, Pronouns, Email, Phone number and they confirm by clicking Done.

3. Choosing Courses From Cornell's Course Roster
The home page displays the user's profile and an empty schedule. When users tap Add classes, they are brought to a course search interface. Users can search by subject or course number. Then they can view matching courses from Cornell’s course roster, with Course number and section (e.g., Chem 2070-001) and tap the course’s plus button to add it to their schedule.

4. Editing Their Schedule (Adding & Deleting Courses)
After selecting courses, the home schedule view updates to show the added classes as large cards. Users can manage their schedule by adding more courses, removing courses, and the app displays the updated schedule immediately.

5. Add Study Buddies
Users can open the side menu and search a course, it will show people who are also in the course, and the user can request to add them as a friend. Besides sending requests to other users, users can also view incoming friend requests and accept/reject them. Users can view current connections(friend list) and remove friends if they want.

Design:
The features designed include a log in page, and then a way for the user to customize their profile. From there, they are able to add their courses to their profile page using a search feature, where the courses are displayed in a calendar type card. There is another tab where the user can search the app for other users that also have the same course as them, and they can choose to connect with that user. Each user’s email and number (optional) is displayed in their profile, so users can easily contact one another. Initially we wanted to include a messaging system, but realized it was too complicated to implement. On the side tab, the user can view the people they already connected with and any requests they made, as well as other people’s requests for them. They can also choose to log out.

For the visual design, I wanted to make an approach that was friendly and easy to read, since there is a bit of text when the user goes to search for their classes. I chose to use SF Pro, because that is the font most apps developed in IOS use, and that is what our front end implementation is. I made my cards and components rounded, for that soft, friendlier look, and also used a pastel color palette. Specifically, I used pink as the main theme, because it is a very fun color that gives of vibes of “caring” and “friendship”. The other colors are all more muted and pastel, to fit in and not seem abrasive on the eye.
